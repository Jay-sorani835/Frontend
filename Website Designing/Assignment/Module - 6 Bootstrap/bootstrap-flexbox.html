In Bootstrap 4, what is flexbox?

- In Bootstrap 4, Flexbox is a powerful layout system that makes it easier to design flexible and responsive layout structures without using floats or positioning tricks.
- Bootstrap 4 is built on top of Flexbox, which means many of its layout components (like the grid, alignment, spacing, and utilities) are powered by Flexbox.

properties or classes : 
.flex-row : Default (horizontal)
.flex-column : Vertical direction
.flex-row-reverse : Reverse horizontal
.flex-column-reverse : Reverse vertical

also we can use the justify content such as : 
.justify-content-center
.justify-content-between
.justify-content-start
.justify-content-end
.justify-content-around


example : 
<div class="d-flex">
  <div>Item 1</div>
  <div>Item 2</div>
  <div>Item 3</div>
</div>
