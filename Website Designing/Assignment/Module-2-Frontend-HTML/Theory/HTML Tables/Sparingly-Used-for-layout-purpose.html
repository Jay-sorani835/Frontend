Why should tables be used sparingly for layout purposes? What is a better
alternative?

- overusing tables for layout purpose can lead issues witn accessibility, maintanance, poor user interaction, and responsiveness.
- a better alternative is to use CSS for layout purposes. CSS is more flexible, maintainable,
- we can use display as grid, flex,etc... using this we can make it responsive and best user interaction.
- It also improve the accessibility of the our webpage, or website that we apply for the layout purpose.
