Discuss the role of semantic HTML. Why is it important for accessibility and SEO?
Provide examples of semantic elements.

- Semantic HTML refers to the use of HTML elements that have meaningful names and explicitly describe their purpose within a webpage. Instead of using generic tags like <div> or <span> for all content, semantic tags convey the structure and meaning of the content.

- Importance of Semantic HTML:
    - Accessibility:

    - Semantic HTML improves the user experience for individuals relying on assistive technologies like screen readers.
    - These tools use semantic elements to understand and navigate the structure of the page, enabling users to easily jump between sections like headers, articles, and navigation links.

    - Search Engine Optimization (SEO):

    - Search engines use semantic HTML to better understand the content and context of a webpage, leading to improved indexing and ranking.
    - Clear structure helps search engines identify key elements, such as main content areas and headings, boosting relevance for targeted keywords.
