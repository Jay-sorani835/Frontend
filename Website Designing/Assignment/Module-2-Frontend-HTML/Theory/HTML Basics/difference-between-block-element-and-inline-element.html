<!-- 
What is the difference between block-level elements and inline elements in HTML? Provide example of each. 

- block level elements are that they occupy the space of the width of the computer screen either he small or not.

- inline element only occupy that space which they only need, like 'this is paragraph tag' wrote in <b>..</b> then this sentence only occupy only the space of the length of the sentence.
example of that is as follow : 
-->
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">

            background-color: aqua;
            font-size: medium;
        }
        b{
            color: blanchedalmond;
            background-color: darkblue;

    </style>
