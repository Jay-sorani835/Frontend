<!-- 
What is the difference between == and === in JavaScript?

- Both are used for comparision or we can use this for checking the value of two variables.
- we can use also in if-else;

- in contexxt of if-else
    - '==' it compare only values of variable that placed on both side. If both are same than continue to if block.
    if both are not same then continue with else block.

    - '===' It also used for comparision but it compare values, and datatypes of the variable that placed on both sides.
    If is true than continue with if block otherwise else block.
