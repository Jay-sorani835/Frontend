<!-- 
Explain the different data types in JavaScript. Provide examples for each. 

- In Javascript there are mainly two types of datatypes 
1.Primitive Datatypes
2. Non-primitive datatypes

1. Primitive Datatypes :
- Primitive datatypes are those datatypes that is pre-defined when the language was defind. It is define dby the programmer.
- Primitive datatypes have further many types:
    - number : It store numeric value such as 1,2, 12.20 etc..
    - string : It store the alphabetic value such as a,b, ab, hello world!, etc..
    - boolean : It store only two value either true or false.
    - symbol : It is used to Store a unique and immutable value.
    - undefined : It defined that the variable is not defined or declared
    - null : It shows that the value of the variable is null means that the variable is not initialized.

2. Non-primitive datatypes :
- Non-primitive datatypes are those datatypes which is a user-defined datatypes. Which is Defined by the user.
- Non-primitive datatypes have further two types:
    - Array : It store the value in sequential manner, it have same datatypes to store the value. the array index is start from 0.
    - Object : It is used to store the property: value format from that we can call the particular value of property or re-assign the value.

Examples:
number :
var a = 10;
var b = 20;
console.log(typeof(a+b));

String : 
var a = 'John';
var b = 'Doe';
console.log(typeof(a+b));

Boolean : 
var a = true;
if(a) console.log(typeof(a));
else a = false;

symbol :


undefined : 
var a;
console.log(typeof(a));

null : 
var a = null;

array :
const a = [1, 2, 3, 4];
console.log(typeof(a));

object :
const user = {firstName:'John', lastName:'Doe', gender:'male', mobile:'1231231231'};
console.log(typeof(user));
