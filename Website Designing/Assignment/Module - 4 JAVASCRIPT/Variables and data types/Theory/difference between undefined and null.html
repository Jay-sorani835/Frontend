<!-- 
What is the difference between undefined and null in JavaScript?

- It signifies that a variable has been declared but has not yet been assigned a value. It also represents the absence of a value in other scenarios, such as accessing a non-existent object property or a function that doesn't explicitly return anything. The engine automatically assigns undefined in these cases.


- null the value of the variable either should be null or not initialized. It is an assignment value. It represents the intentional absence of an object value. The developer must explicitly assign null to a variable to indicate that it has no value.
