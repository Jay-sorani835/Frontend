What are variables in JavaScript? How do you declare a variable using var, let, and 
const? 

- variable is a container for storing data values.
- In Javascript there is three types of identifiers of the variable namely let, const and var.

- var: It is used to declare a variable that can be re-assigned. It has function scope or global scope.
       we can re declare the same variable.

- let: It is used to declare a variable that can be re-assigned. It has block scope.
       We can't declare a same variable as var do.

- const: It is used to declare a variable with constant value. We can't re-declare it or re-assigned it.

examples of declaring the variables: 
- var name = 'John';
- let age = 30;
