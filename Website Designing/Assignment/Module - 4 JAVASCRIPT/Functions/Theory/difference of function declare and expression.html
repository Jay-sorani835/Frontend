<!--
What is the difference between a function declaration and a function expression? 

Function Declaration :
 -Declared with the function keyword at the start.
- Has a name.
- Hoisted, meaning it can be called before the declaration in the code.

Syntax:
function functionName() {
    //statements
}

Function Expression :
- A function assigned to a variable.
- Can be anonymous (no name) or named.
- Not hoisted, so you cannot call it before the assignment.

Syntax:
const variableName = function(){
    //code of statments
}

- using arrow:
const variableName = () => {
    //statements
}
