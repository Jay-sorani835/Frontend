<!-- 
What is error handling in JavaScript? Explain the try, catch, and finally blocks with an example.

- Error handling is that in which the programmer knows that where is error and how to handle that error.
- Error handling in JavaScript is the process of writing code to manage runtime errors gracefully — without crashing the program. It allows you to detect, handle, and recover from exceptions (unexpected problems).

basic structure of the error handling : 
try {
  // Code that might throw an error
} catch (error) {
  // Code to handle the error
} finally {
  // Code that always runs (optional)
}


here the example of the divide by zero error occur and handle it : 
let num = 10;
try{
    let divide = num / 0;
    console.log(divide);
}
catch(error){
    console.log("Error is : " , error);
}
finally{
    console.log("this is finally block");
}
