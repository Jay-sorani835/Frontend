<!-- 
What is the difference between a while loop and a do-while loop? 

condition checking : 
while loop :
the condition is checked before each execution of the loop's body. If the condition is initially false, the loop body will never execute.
do-while loop : 
The condition is checked after each execution of the loop's body. This ensures that the loop body executes at least once, regardless of the initial condition. 

execution of body : 
while :
body may not execute at all.
do-while : 
the body will execute at least once.

use case : 
while:
when initial condition matters.
do-while : 
when code need to run at least once.

syntax : 
while : while(condition){..}
do-while : do{..}while(conditon);
