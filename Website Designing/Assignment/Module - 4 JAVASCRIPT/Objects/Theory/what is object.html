What is an object in JavaScript? How are objects different from arrays? 

- Object is one type of container that store the property and their values.
- An object is a data structure used to store key-value pairs.
- Each key (also called a property) is a string (or symbol), and each value can be any data type — string, number, function, object, etc.

syntax : 

const objectName = {
    property1 : value1,
    property2 : value2,
    property3 : value3,
    property4 : value4
}
example : 
const person = {
  name: "Alice",
  age: 25,
  isStudent: true
};


- the object is differ from array because the array structure is ordered list while object structure is key-vlaue pair.
- array is sorted while the object is not sorted or unordered format.
- array is used to collect the items while object is represent the enitities with properties.
- array is access by the index such as array[0] while the property is access by the object name such as objectName.property
