<!-- 
Describe how switch statements work in JavaScript. When should you use a 
switch statement instead of if-else? 

- Switch statment is one type of switching the block of codes using some cases or value of the variable that passing into the switch(..).

- Switch statement is used when we have to sure that the only possibility of this type of problem such as in calculating the day of the week, in that we sure that there is only 7 possibility, than we can use this.
- another example is that when making backend calculator we ask user to input such operation that user want to perform at that time we can use the switch statement because we have sure that the only possible operations such as if user enter + than the case which have value'+' than that block is execute.

example:

var a = parseInt(prompt('enter the number : '));
switch(a){
case 1 : console.log('monday');
break;
case 2 : console.log('tuesday');
break;
case 3 : console.log('wednesday');
break
case 4 : console.log('thursday');
break;
case 5 : console.log('friday');
break;
case 6 : console.log('saturday');
break;
case 7 : console.log('sunday');
break;
default : console.log('Enter valid number');
}
