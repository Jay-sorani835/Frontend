How is JavaScript different from other programming languages like Python or Java? 

- JavaScript is a high-level, interpreted programming language that is primarily used for web development. It is different from other programming languages like Python or Java in several ways:

Interpreted vs. Compiled: 
- JavaScript is an interpreted language, meaning that it is executed line by line at runtime, while Python and Java are typically compiled languages. This allows for faster development and testing cycles in JavaScript.

typing:
- JavaScript is a dynamically typed language, meaning that variables do not have a fixed type and can change type at runtime. Python is also dynamically typed, while Java is statically typed, meaning that variable types must be declared at compile time.

Object-Oriented vs. Prototype-Based: 
- JavaScript uses a prototype-based object-oriented programming model, while Python and Java use class-based object-oriented programming. This means that in JavaScript, objects can inherit directly from other objects, while in Python and Java, classes are used to define the structure and behavior of objects.

use case:
- Javascript is primarily use for web development, especially for client-side scripting in browser.It runs only on browser. Python is a general-purpose programming language that can be used for a wide range of applications, including web development, data analysis, machine learning, and more. Java is also a general-purpose programming language that is widely used for enterprise applications, mobile app development, and large-scale systems.
