- box sizing has two types : 
    1. border-box

    - Border-box is that if we give the border-box as box-sizing than the height & width we give to the content or html document that should divide into the border also. border doesn't access any other size or space.

    ex. Suppose we give the 100px to the box model and than including the border and padding are should be in 100px size.

    2. Content Box : 
    - It describes that the size of the content - box is only apply on the content not on border or padding also.
