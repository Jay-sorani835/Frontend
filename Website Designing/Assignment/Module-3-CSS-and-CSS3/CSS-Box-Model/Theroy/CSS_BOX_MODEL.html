Explain the CSS box model and its components (content, padding, border,
margin). How does each affect the size of an element?

- CSS Box Model contain four things
    - Margin
    - Border
    - Padding
    - Content

    - Content is that in which the actual html document should be there.

    - border is that using this we can give the border to the html content. In the form of pixels.

    - padding is the space between content and border.

    - margin is the space aroo=und the border and it's default value is 8px.


All the margin, border, padding and obvious content that take some size and also all are affect each other for i's size. such as we give the margin 10px than it is affact the border also and content also in the output but we can't see that in the form of live but we can see that through the inspect or CSS Model that give.
