    <h3>CSS Selectors</h3>
    <p>A CSS selector selects the HTML element(s) you want to style.</p>
    <p>CSS selectors are used to "find" (or select) the HTML elements you want to style.</p>  
    <p>We can divide CSS selectors into five categories:</p>
    <ul>    
        <li>Simple selectors (select elements based on name, id, class)</li>
        <li>Combinator selectors (select elements based on a specific relationship between them)</li>
        <li>Pseudo-class selectors (select elements based on a certain state)</li>
        <li>Pseudo-elements selectors (select and style a part of an element)</li>
        <li>Attribute selectors (select elements based on an attribute or attribute value)</li>
    </ul>
